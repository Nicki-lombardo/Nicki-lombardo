 ðŸš€ ## To achieve this, I rely on a set of essential tools that every Full Stack developer and web designer should be familiar with:

# key programming languages:

1. Django: Python Frameworks
   
2. JavaScript:  Ecosystem of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. 

3. HTML: Standard markup language used for structuring and marking up web pages. 

4. CSS: While not a programming language per se, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is crucial for styling web pages. It complements HTML and ensures visually appealing designs.

5. TypeScript: An extension of JavaScript, TypeScript offers static typing and additional features.
   
6.  Tools: 1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 2. Backbone.js 3. CodePen: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, frameworks and libraries, such as Vue.js and React. 4. Webpack 5. Vite 6. Parcel
